CAT 2024 will enable students to apply for admission to the IIMs and other leading institutes for the academic session of 2024-2026.
To be considered for MBA programs, students need to successfully pass this examination and meet the required minimum scores. Only those who meet the cut-off criteria will proceed to the subsequent selection rounds conducted by the institutions.</description></item></channel></rss>
