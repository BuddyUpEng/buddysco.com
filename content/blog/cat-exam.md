The Common Admission Test (CAT), which takes place every year under the supervision of the IIMs, is the primary entrance examination for prestigious business schools offering MBA programs. CAT 2024 will enable students to apply for admission to the IIMs and other leading institutes for the academic session of 2024-2026.

  

To be considered for MBA programs, students need to successfully pass this examination and meet the required minimum scores. Only those who meet the cut-off criteria will proceed to the subsequent selection rounds conducted by the institutions.

  

Before deciding to take the CAT exam, individuals should visit the website and/or carefully review the program advertisement of the relevant IIM and specific programs. This is important to ensure that they have access to accurate and up-to-date information about the programs they intend to apply for, including eligibility criteria and admission procedures.

  

The candidates must also note that IIMs have no role in the selection process of non-IIM institutions.

**PERCENTILE SCORE CALCULATION METHOD:**

  

Steps for Calculating CAT Overall and Sectional Percentile Scores (we have chosen the QA section for this example, similar process can be done for the other two section and the overall CAT percentile score as well):

  

Step 1. Determine the total number of candidates (N) who took the CAT exam, including all sessions.

  

Step 2. Assign ranks (r) to candidates based on their scaled scores in the QA section. If multiple candidates have the same scaled score, they will receive the same rank.

  

Step 3. Calculate the percentile score (P) for a candidate with rank (r) in the QA section using the formula: P = ((N - r) / N) x 100.

  

Step 4. Round off the calculated percentile score (P) to two decimal points. For example, scores equal to or above 99.995 are rounded off to 100, scores above or equal to 99.985 but less than 99.995 are rounded off to 99.99, and so on.

  

Step 5. Similar methodology is used to compute percentile scores for the overall CAT score and for the other sections (DILR and VARC) in CAT 2023.

  

**RESULTS:**

  

The CAT results are expected to be published on the official website around December. These results usually remain valid until December.

  

In addition, the IIMs will announce the cut-off scores for the batches. It's important to note that there is no centralized counseling process for the CAT exam, as each IIM has its own unique procedure for conducting interviews and subsequent admission rounds.
